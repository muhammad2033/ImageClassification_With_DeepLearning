These are just training codes that are done by me on Google Colab.
I have worked so many models of transfer learning.
Go to these all files , run on google colab , that may help you a lot , we are trying these are models , coz we want to see the best model and higher accurator.
That gives much accuracy on training as well as on validation, That's why are trying these all models.
