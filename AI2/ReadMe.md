These are just training codes that are done by me on Google Colab.
I have worked so many models of transfer learning.
Go to these all files , run on google colab , that may help you a lot , we are trying these are models , coz we want to see the best model and higher accurator.
That gives much accuracy on training as well as on validation, That's why are trying these all models.

At the end of running the code on colab , save the model with .h5 .That must keep in mind 
Like;
model.save("anyName.h5")

# streamlit
I will upload the steamlit codes for concern datasets of kaggle and I will apply the following transfer learning model.
