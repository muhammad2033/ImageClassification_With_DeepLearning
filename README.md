# ImageClassification_With_DeepLearning
# why do we move to deep Learning from Machine Learning?
Deep learning, a type of machine learning, uses deep neural networks with multiple layers. It's favored because these networks can automatically learn intricate patterns from data, making them especially good at tasks like image and speech recognition. The complexity of deep learning enables better handling of large and unstructured datasets, outperforming traditional machine learning in certain applications.

These are just training codes that are done by me on Google Colab. I have worked so many models of transfer learning. Go to these all files , run on google colab , that may help you a lot , we are trying these are models , coz we want to see the best model and higher accurator. That gives much accuracy on training as well as on validation, That's why are trying these all models.

At the end of running the code on colab , save the model with .h5 .That must keep in mind Like; model.save("anyName.h5")

I will upload the steamlit codes for concern datasets from kaggle and I will apply the following transfer learning model.
